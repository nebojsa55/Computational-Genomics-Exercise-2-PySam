# Using PySam for reading and analyzing SAM/BAM files

The Jupyter notebook was created for the purpose of Exercise 2 in the course [Genome Informatics](https://github.com/vladimirkovacevic/gi-2021-etf). The goal is to read and extract certain information from the BAM file **'merged-tumor.bam'**. The data is available as a part of [Seven Bridges Genomics](https://cgc.sbgenomics.com) public cloud data.

## Analysis result
|  Total number of reads 	|  Unmapped reads in the file 	|   Reads with with mapping quality 0	|  Average mapping quality  |  
|:-----------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| 2,921,629               | 17,765                        | 126,628                             | 55.91                     |
