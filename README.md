# Using PySam for reading and analyzing SAM/BAM files

The Jupyter notebook was created as part of Exercise 2 in the course [Genome Informatics](https://github.com/vladimirkovacevic/gi-2021-etf). The goal is to read and extract certain information from the BAM file **'merged-tumor.bam'**. The data is available as a part of [Seven Bridges Genomics](https://cgc.sbgenomics.com) public cloud data.
